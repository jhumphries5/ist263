    My name is Janelle Humphries, and I am a senior at Syracuse University. I am currently studying Information Management and Technology with a concentration in data analytics at the ischool. Throughout my time in school, I have learned multiple coding languages such as Python, R, and SQL. I had an internship last summer where I was a technical project manager at a software development firm in Albany, NY. Some of my hobbies include cooking and fitness.
